		<p>I am Aiden Morris. I am from the North West of the US and have spent little less than half my current life overseas in Kampala, Uganda. I am married and currently expecting the arrival of my first child. I am a certified IT professionaland avid aficionado of all things technology.</p>
		
		<p>I am, what you might call, an introverted extrovert. I enjoy working with and being around people, but I do also tend to be fairly quiet and reserved.
		</p>
		
		<p>Learning is my nonstop state of being, though that is not to say that I lack knowledge or skills. Simply, I am not satisfied with an absence of knowledge or critical thought about any given topic</p>
