		<li class="listformat"><b>CompTIA A+</b></li>
			<span class="img_float_l"><img src="assets/CompTIA_Aplus.png" alt="CompTIA A plus Cert"></span>
			<p class = "list_text">This certification is a general knowledge certification that gives me the knowledge and skills to work in any Technical Support position. Additionally, this certification give enough of a baseline knowledge of computer systems, that it is great asset in any IT position at any level. Finally, this certification compounds with others to almost exponentially increase my skills in IT.</p>
			
			
	
		<li class="listformat"><b>CompTIA Server+</b></li>
			<span class="img_float_l"><img src="assets/CompTIA_Serverplus.png" alt = "CompTIA Server plus Cert"></span>
			<p class="list_text">Often this certification is known as A+ but for servers. This fine tunes the knowledge gained by A+ to increase knowledge and skills in server administration and maintenance. Server+ is a great asset in any position, as knowledge of servers and clients is mandatory for support positions. This is particularly true in a world where cloud technologies and hosted services are growing.</p>
	
			
	
		<li class="listformat"><b>CompTIA Network+</b></li>
			<span class="img_float_l"><img src="assets/CompTIA_Netplus.png" alt="CompTIA Network plus Cert"></span>
			<p class="list_text">Network+ is the foundational certification for understanding computer networks. It is essentially the general version of the CCNA certification. Network+ is very useful to have in any position, as it is a field that is inherently part of every single aspect of IT. What use is any computer system to a global company if it is unable to connect to anything else? Network+ increases my value as a programmer especially, as it teaches a discipline that many programmers do not invest in.</p>
	
	
		<li class="listformat"><b>LPI Linux Essentials</b></li>
			<span class="img_float_l"><img src="assets/LE-11024_1.png" alt="LPI Linux Essentials cert"></span>
			<p class = "list_text">This certification increases the range of computer systems that I have fluency in. While Linux is different from MacOS, familiarity with the Terminal allows for expertise to be exercised on any Unix-based systems. This certification teaches the fundamental concepts and means by which an IT professional can administrate, network, and troubleshoot any Linux system.</p>

		<li class="listformat" id="MTA_pic"><b>MTA Server Adminstration - MTA Security Fundamentals - MTA Networking Fundamentals</b></li>
			<span class="img_float_l"><img src="assets/MTACerts.png" alt = "MTA certifications"></span>
			<p class="list_text">MTA Security Fundamentals, Networking, and Server Adminstration are part of a suite of certifications that are no longer offered, however, the knowledge gained is still very much valid. MTA Networking and MTA Security hone my knowledge of cybersecurity and networking, while MTA Server Adminstration is a certification known for its focus on Active Directory. This knowledge of AD makes me very useful as a system administrator or technical support specialist.</p>
